"""Lightweight local metrics — a structured log line plus a small in-memory ring.

Generalised from Edibl's `chat_metrics`, whose shape had already been proven:

* the **log line is the authoritative record**. It is the only thing that spans
  all processes (two gunicorn workers plus the MCP sidecar), survives a restart,
  and can be read back by the debug tooling.
* the **ring is a convenience**. It is per-process, so a request served by the
  other worker is simply not in it — treat it as a recent sample, never a total.
  That caveat is the reason the log line exists rather than the ring being "the"
  metric store.

Nothing here leaves the machine. There is no scrape endpoint and no push.
