"""Configure logging once, for every process myMeal runs.

Before this existed, myMeal configured logging **nowhere**. The effective
level for the app logger was WARNING, so every ``_LOGGER.info(...)`` — most of
the startup and diagnostic logging — was silently discarded, and the only
handler present had been installed as a side effect of Alembic's ``fileConfig``
during migrations. Logs that vanish are worse than no logs: they read as "the
app had nothing to say".

Two sinks:

* **stdout** — what the Home Assistant add-on log tab shows, and what an
  operator pastes into an issue.
* **a file** under ``<DATA_DIR>/logs/`` — because stdout is captured by the
  container runtime, not by us, so the app cannot read its own history back.
  The debug tooling reads these files.

Why one file *per process*: three processes write concurrently (two gunicorn
workers plus the MCP sidecar), and ``RotatingFileHandler`` rotation is not
multi-process safe — two processes rolling the same file races and loses lines.
With a pid in the name, each process only ever rotates its own file and the
reader merges by timestamp. Bounded by ``MAX_BYTES * (BACKUPS + 1)`` per
process; ``/data`` is real host disk that this project's own disk-full runbook
alerts on, so the cap is not optional.

Timestamps are ISO-8601 **UTC** with an explicit ``Z``. The container ships no
tzdata and gets no TZ from the Supervisor, so local time is not available —
making that explicit beats emitting an ambiguous naive timestamp.
