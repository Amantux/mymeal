# Changelog

## 0.4.0 — Conversational cooking agent (Milestone 4)

### Added
- **Cooking assistant** (`POST /api/v1/ai/chat`): a provider-agnostic
  tool-calling agent over the group's data. Tools: `search_recipes`,
  `get_recipe`, `list_pantry`, `what_can_i_cook`, `whats_for_dinner`,
  `add_to_shopping_list`. The tool loop feeds results back as text so it runs
  identically on Claude, OpenAI, and Ollama; the executors are reused by the
  MCP server later.
- `ChatSession`/`ChatMessage` models with a tool-call trace; session
  list/get/delete endpoints. Group-isolated. Chat view in the SPA.

### Fixed (M3 review)
- `/ai/plan` no longer 500s on off-shape provider JSON (non-list `days`,
  string `meals`, non-dict entries) or malformed request bodies.
- Non-numeric `servings`/`quantity` on the meal-plan, pantry, and shopping
  endpoints now coerce via shared `to_int`/`to_float` helpers instead of 500.

## 0.3.0 — Meal planning, pantry & smart shopping lists (Milestone 3)

### Added
- **Meal planning**: `MealPlanEntry` model + `/api/v1/mealplans` (date-range
  query, CRUD) and a weekly-calendar view.
- **Pantry**: `PantryItem` model + `/api/v1/pantry` CRUD and a Pantry view.
- **Smart shopping lists**: `ShoppingList`/`ShoppingListItem` + a consolidating
  builder (merges duplicate ingredients, groups by aisle). Build from selected
  recipes or from a meal-plan date range; aisle-grouped Shopping view.
- **AI meal planning** (`POST /ai/plan`): generates a plan from the group's
  recipes + preferences and saves it as plan entries.
- **Pantry-aware suggestions** (`POST /ai/suggest`): deterministic
  "what can I cook now?" ranking by pantry coverage (no provider required).

### Fixed (M2 review)
- Recipe import no longer 500s on array/object-valued schema.org fields or on
  non-object model output; both degrade cleanly.
- **SSRF guard** on the import fetch: rejects non-http(s) and private/loopback/
  link-local/metadata addresses, validates each redirect hop, caps body size.
- Non-string / malformed import inputs return 4xx, not 500.

## 0.2.0 — AI recipe import + provider layer (Milestone 2)

### Added
- **Pluggable AI provider layer** (`services/ai/`): one interface, three
  adapters — **Claude** (`claude-opus-4-8`), **OpenAI**, and **Ollama** (local).
  Selected via `MYMEAL_AI_PROVIDER`; `GET /api/v1/ai/providers` reports status.
- **Recipe import** (`POST /api/v1/ai/import`): imports from a URL or pasted
  text. URLs try deterministic schema.org/JSON-LD extraction first (no tokens),
  falling back to the AI provider; text always uses the provider.
- **Frontend**: an Import view (link or paste) and a Settings view showing
  provider status.
- Tests for JSON-LD extraction, ISO-8601 duration parsing, and both import
  paths using a fake provider (no network/keys).

## 0.1.0 — Foundation (Milestone 1)

Initial scaffold of **myMeal**, a self-hosted recipe manager, AI meal planner,
and Home Assistant cooking assistant.

### Added
- **Backend** (Flask + SQLAlchemy 2.0): app factory, `MYMEAL_`-prefixed config,
  JWT auth with a `MYMEAL_DISABLE_AUTH` ingress mode, and long-lived API keys.
- **Data model**: recipes (with structured ingredients & steps), foods, units,
  categories, tags, users, groups — multi-tenant by group.
- **REST API** under `/api/v1`: recipe CRUD (with slug lookup, favorites, image
  upload), foods/units, categories, tags, cross-entity search, and token/user
  management.
- **Frontend** (Vue 3 + Vite + Pinia): dashboard, recipe browser, recipe
  view/edit, login/registration, and a Home Assistant setup page.
- **Packaging**: multi-stage Dockerfile, unified entrypoint (standalone + HA
  add-on), docker-compose, HA add-on `config.yaml`, HACS metadata, and CI
  (tests + lint + frontend build + add-on validation).
